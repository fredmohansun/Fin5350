# Summary of *The Use of Knowledge in Society* by F. A. Hayek, 1945

1. Hayek based his paper on refuting common asssumptions economists made to solve economic problem. He believes that the whole "data", or **the knowledge about of the partiular circumstances of time and place**, is not given to any individual. These knowledge never exists in concetrated or integrated form but dispersed among seperate individuals, which might be incomplete and contradictory. Hayek believes the economic problem the society faces is "**a problem of the utilization of knowledge not given to anyone in its totality**".

2. By "Planning", Hayek meens that it is the complex of interrelated decisions about the allocation of our available resources. Besides the problem of utilizing dipersed knowledge, there is also a problem of "**_who_ is to do the planning**". Hayek points out that planning can either be done in a centralized way, a decentralized way, or a mixture of the two, depending on which way can be more efficient, or "fuller use of the existing knowledge".

3. According to Hayek, there is a difference between the relative importance of the different kinds of knowledge to every individual. This is because besides the organized knowledge, unorganzied knowledge, or the knowledge about of the partiular circumstances of time and place, exists and is only in the possession of some individuals. These knowledge cannot be maed good use of unless the individual possess them is making decision himself/herself or cooperate with planning. Society has to find a method to made these specific knowledge as widely available as possible.

4. Hayek stressed that it is not the fact that a plan can be laid down and closely adhered to for a long period of time. Every day individual are doing optimization. And as the existence of frequently changes, which are not counted in the aggeregate statistic model, decision making are required at almost every moment of time. So even central planner have to find some way to make specific decison by giving them to individuals with such knowledge, which is referred to as "**Man on the spot**".

5. But since the "Man on the spot" possess only his/her knowledge and cannot make decisions unless he/she can get additional knowledge required from surrroundings, economy has to find some way to communicating these knowledge. Hayek thinks that "All that is significant for him is _how much more or less_ difficult to produce they have become compared with other things with which he is also concerned." Or in other words, the only knowledge significant to an individual is the knowledge about the relative value of his/her factor and production. And price solved most of this problem. This is done by "limited individual fields of vision sufficiently overlap so that through many intermediaries the relevant information is communicated to all."

6. One property of price system is that "only the most essential inforamtion is passed on, and passed on only to those concerned." So plan adjusments are never "perfect" according to Hayek. Therefore, market are usually on a disequilibrium but always has the dynamic toward its equilibrium. Price system also made it possible that "not only a division of labor but also a coordinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge".

# Summary of *Proof that Properly Anticipated Price Fluctuate Randomly* by Paul A. Samuelson, 1965

_This Article is based heavily on probability theory. For now, I don't have too much relevant knowledge in this field. I'll try my best to summarize this article_

1. According to Samuelson's idea, "prices depends on a summation of so many small and somewhat independent souces of variation that the result is like a random walk." And he shows htath next period's difference is uncorrelated with previous period's price difference. And if we assume no interest and risk neutral, the martingale property of zero expected capital gain holds.

2.
