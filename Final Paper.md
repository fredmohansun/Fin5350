## The Use of Model in Financial Economics

There is always, and will always be, a debate on whether models can be used in economics and the role of modeling among economists. Austrian economists like Hayek would think that "economy is too complex to model", while other applied economists, which seems to take the majority seats recently, as development in technology led to evolution in machines' computing power and far more efficient algorithm, would argue the opposite. Their idea, however, are not mutually exclusive with each other. Opinion of Austrian economists is correct because it is never possible to include all factors in a quantitative model that influence a process for both the reason of inefficiency and unavailability of data of some factors. However, the fact that investors frequently make money by doing firm analysis with valuation models suggest the opinion of applied economists also works. This reveals the fact that models used in Financial Economics, although can never be perfect, still have explanatory power toward the mechanism of economy.

### The Utopia of Perfect Modeling

We can think of a perfect model as a model which can always output the exact answer to all potential event inputted. Let's begin with some basic models that is used in other fields of study. We all know that according to Newton's second law, the acceleration _a_, is the ratio of the Force, _F_, imposed on an object to the mass of the object, _m_, or _a = F/m_. This model looks good enough, and it also proven to be exact in those High-End physics laboratory.

But is the model perfect? Probably not. There are too much factors neglected. Put aside Einstein's Theory of Relativity, the model still face a lot of problems. One example is that the object in question is assumed to be an particle, or no volume at all. But there is nothing like that in reality to our best knowledge. So this model is not exact and failed to explain or predict the motion of an object with shape, like body of human.

By the same definition, a perfect model is the model which include all possible events in a economy. Besides external factors, which are usually included in most model we used today, change in all internal factors should also be included in the model. That is, you also need to integrate all information from economy participants to make a model 100% accurate response for all inputs. The only way to achieve such a goal is to connect to everything like Matrix. 

Take one step further, the object that models want to explain, namely economy itself, is a system as well. Due to the same reason that impossibility to include all the input cases, there is always a problem of inefficiency as private information can never be wholly included in the economy, or the output of the system, namely the prices. Therefore, there is no point in expecting a specific case, or the modeling used in Financial economics, of an inefficient system to be perfect.

Even if we could gather all data and information for a model, we can probably say that the model is good "at that time". Unlike physics, whose model can be constant, the economy is evolving everyday. So if the model used is an empirical one, we can expect the model evolve with the system every point-in-time. Such model is perfect in a sense, but it can never be used to assist our understanding the economy. For a theoretical model, an update in the database used would probably create some outliers not covered by the model. It is less affected by timeliness than empirical model, but is not free from it.

The two reasons stated above show exactly why a Planned Economy never works in practice, as Hayek argued in his paper _the Use of Knowledge in Society_. This suggests that no model can explain the whole economy perfectly. But even if the scope is narrowed from population to sample, there is still not a perfect model.

In the finance industry, analysts used model whose scope is narrowed to a specific firm. Although I mentioned before that investors frequently make money by doing firm analysis, this doesn't necessarily suggest the model used in the firm analysis process is perfect. It is indeed relatively easier to gather all information and data of a specific firm instead of the whole economy system. Investors also know how to use it base on the time frame of the analysis. But it is also the fact that this model doesn't work everytime the model is used.

For example, the most commonly used method in valuing a normal manufacturing firm is the _Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity Model_, or simply the DCF model. However, if you take a look at different analysis, you will find that the fair market value per share of the same firm calculated by two different analysts can be far from each other. A major reason of the difference lies in the different asssumptions analysts made. These assumptions are some complex conditions which cannot be quantified with ease. The DCF model is seldom convincing and probably never work with model itself without assumptions in its context. So even if the model used is the same, it can fail to give the exact solution to a problem sometimes if the model is not used properly. The same problem can be easily found in all other valuation methods as well.

Lest someone would argue that DCF is just system of equations which is too simple to be thought as a "model", let's take a look at the example of High frequency trading. It has the same scope as a normal vaulation model, but the model executed in those super computers is much more complex than the basic DCF model. Even so, high frequency traders still fail a lot. The famous Flash Crash in 2010 is contributed by the high frequency traders by some degree. Those super computers, even though they are smart enough, are still just machine. It can be really hard for them to be 100% sure of the model to be used for some specific occasions.

Therefore, even if all data is available, and time frame is deliberated, a model can still fail because it depends on occasions. A model integrates all relevant factors and is time-effective for a case may not works for another. All these three points suggest that a perfect model which can always give exact solution with all potential input events probably doesn't exist.

However, even if a model fail to give us an exact number or solution, the solution could still help us understand the idea behind some phenomenon.

Let's take another look at the example of Newton's Second Law. What can we learn from the model of _a = F/m_? Does a greater force imposed on the object lead to greater acceleration? True. Does a greater mass of an object lead to more difficulty to acclerate or decelerate? True. These two statements are correct even if assumptions about the objects are made. And with them you can understand quite a few problems regarding object motion, like why trucks are more likely to crash than cars. Note that we don't even need to know what the exact acceleration is for cars and trucks.

The model can often fail to give the exact solutions to the problem economists faces. But with the model we can understand a lot of facts, if we can change a way to think about our models.

### The Beauty of Properties

A property can always tell you as much information as, if not more than, the model and an exact solution. Like the example of Newton's Second Law, it is also true for models used in Financial Economics. However, most properties doesn't give the solution directly, and they requires interpretation of these properties from economists or financial analysts to form a thesis or understand a phenomena. And this is the ideal relationship between economists and models.

One example of this idea is the study of behavioral economics. We solve the utility maximization problem using Lagrange. However, neither the utility nor the Lagrange Equation matters. What really matters are the properties of the solution, usually of consumptions and savings. We can set a beta to study how people's preference change with time, and learn from beta that a procrastinator will always have distorted consumption patterns. And from this properties we can test if a SMarT plan can offset the adverse of proctastination. And for all of this research we doesn't base our understanding on any particular solution, but base on properties of the models.

By focusing more on properties than the model itself, there is a better chance to notice the flaw in thesis and have a better understanding of a phenomena. Once I was reading a paper about bank bailout policy. And then I realized one of the graph didn't make any intuitive sense. The graph suggest that in a riskier world the bank are less likely to fail. After much study of this property I realized that it is due to the fact that bankers become more conservative if they know they are exposed to more risk. And probably I won't have this understanding if I just focus on if the parameters are correct or not.

A modeler is always subject to such a bias that you want to defend your current model, and then learn more about the methodology in modeling. It is really hard to throw away what you have been working for days or weeks or even longer to restart from the scratch line. And the feeling of being beaten by admitting the model is not good enough hurts people a lot. But it is also true that the longer time your spends on perfecting your model, although you cannot get a perfect one, the less time and willingness you have to think why it's going wrong. And the product of your research might just be a model that is good enough to explain a specific case instead of a thesis that can solve the problem globally.

And Even if a model cannot give an exact quantitative result, it is still capable of being exact on qualitative analysis. In almost every firm analysis with valuation model, another session called sensitivity test, or some kinds of Hypothesis testing, is always included to suggest how confidence the recommendation of buy/hold/sell is. I have to say Hypothesis Testing is one of the greatest statistic techniques created. It solve the equality problem by solving inequations. And with these inequality you know more than just the fact of if the calculated value is significantly away from the spot value. Again such properties give you more than just an equation.


### Conclusion

Therefore, despite the fact that models can never be perfect because of unavailability of data, problem of timeliness and occasion-dependence, they can still help you understanding the problem you are working on by providing meaningful properties and an exact qualitative result. And it's time to re-think the relationship between your model and yourself. See if the model is orienting you or the opposite.
